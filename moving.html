    <h3 class="articleHeader">Moving from print to web</h3>
    <p>For most designers,  making the transition from print design to web design can be a  frustrating process. At first it seems easy. You&rsquo;re a visual designer,    so design is design regardless of medium…right?! Undaunted, you jump    right in and the next thing you know you are confronted with the most  dizzying array of acronyms this side of the military. Suddenly you find  yourself surrounded by terms like CSS, XHTML, PHP, AJAX, XSLT and  countless other shorthand terms for technologies you never wanted to  learn. It can be more than a little intimidating.</p>
<p>Recently this question was put to me during an interview with Deke McClelland during his <a title="The Deke" href="http://www.deke.com" target="_blank"><em>Martini Hour</em></a> show, and during my discussion with Deke I decided to write a more  thought-out response here, detailing what I&rsquo;ve learned over the years    about web design and how a new designer might go about making the  transition. So here goes it (and Deke, here&rsquo;s that more detailed  answer…), a few tips from me to you on how to successfully design for    both the print and the web.</p>
<h2>Learn your craft</h2>
<p>Are any of your  friends web developers, stock brokers, or fast food employees? Imagine  them purchasing a copy of InDesign and then taking on a Fortune 500  company&rsquo;s annual report as their first project. Sound funny? Well, I&rsquo;ve    seen plenty of print designers do just that. They&rsquo;ll snag a copy of <a title="Oh, oh Dreamweaver..." href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/?promoid=BPDEC" target="_blank">Dreamweaver</a> and fumble about, cursing the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t work like InDesign  as they try to put together a web site for their largest in-house  client. Web design is not a subset of print design; it is not    subordinate to it nor is it something you can pick up over a weekend.  Web design is a discipline that requires your full attention. Learn your  craft. As distasteful as it may seem at first, at a minimum you need to    be comfortable with both <a title="check it!" href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/" target="_blank">XHTML</a> and <a title="Reading is fundamental" href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" target="_blank">CSS.</a> Technology is a tool; it allows us to get the stuff we see in our head  to the printed page and onto the screen. Not knowing your tool means not    being able to fully realize your vision.</p>
<h2>Decide what you want to focus on</h2>
<p>Do you want to build  awesome dynamically driven ecommerce sites? Or perhaps you want to  create immersive interactive experiences? Maybe you&rsquo;re more interested  in clean, well-structured front end design? Or maybe you want to build  easy to maintain sites through the use of content management software    such as joomla or drupal. Regardless, one of the best pieces of advice I    can give is to choose a direction and then dedicate yourself to  mastering that aspect of web design. Becoming known for a specific area    of web design or development is not a bad thing, it gives you a niche  that you can carve out for yourself and serve as the foundation for your  work. You&rsquo;ll find that you can give clients more consistent,  professional results, and that you&rsquo;ll become a proficient web designer  faster. It also then allows you to move on to other aspects of web  design or development, and that helps me make my next point:</p>
<h2>Eat the elephant slowly</h2>
<p>The web is a big place…and there&rsquo;s a lot going on. PHP, .NET, or ColdFusion? <a title="word" href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, <a title="Who moved my type?" href="http://www.movabletype.com/" target="_blank">Movable Type</a>, or <a title="express yourself" href="http://expressionengine.com/" target="_blank">Expression Engine</a>?  Joomla or Drupal? Flash or AJAX? CSS or… well, OK, you HAVE to learn    CSS, but my point is there is so much to learn that it can often seem a  bit overwhelming. Sure the cool kids seem to know everything,  but in reality if you talk to them there is a laundry list of stuff  they haven&rsquo;t gotten around to learning yet. Start with your core skills,  and move outward from there. Once you get a handle on one area of web  design, you&rsquo;ll find that projects just naturally move you into another.  After a few years go by, you&rsquo;ll be amazed at how far you&rsquo;ve come. The    trick is to not get frustrated and to understand one very important  rule… you will fail, and you will break stuff. That&rsquo;s how we learn.</p>
<div class="panel callout radius centered">
<p>Hey, can I make my  page look exactly the same on Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera, Firefox,  and Chrome?! Can I make sure that regardless of platform or device my  headlines work the same with my paragraphs? Is it possible to create a  pixel perfect design and display it across multiple systems in a    standards-compliant manner?</p>
    <p>No. Get over it.</p>
    </div>
<p class="postcallout">So that&rsquo;s it really. It&rsquo;s simple when you boil it down to a single  statement: &ldquo;There is no &lsquo;make webpage&rsquo; button in InDesign, nor should  there be one. Quit pouting and go learn how to be a web designer.&rdquo; Where  do you start? Well, there are some <a title="Read Steve's Krug's book!" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=web+design&x=0&y=0" target="_blank">great books</a> on learning web design, you could always <a title="We could hang out..." href="http://www.lodestone.com" target="_blank">take a class</a>, and there are some excellent <a title="shameless self promotion" href="http://www.lynda.com/home/ViewCourses.aspx?lpk1=128" target="_blank">online</a> <a title="yet more self promotion" href="http://tv.adobe.com/#pd+Dreamweaver" target="_blank">tutorials</a>. In the end, nothing beats rolling up your sleeves and just getting to work.</p>
